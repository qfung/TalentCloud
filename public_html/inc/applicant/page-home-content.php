                    <p>Digital isn't just about building apps, or using the latest technology. It's about putting people first, by designing services that are focused on what users need.</p>
                    <p>We're about making it faster, simpler, and easier, to access government services online.</p>
                    <p>We are bringing together top talent from inside and outside of government that includes developers, designers, data scientists and user experience researchers. We're partnering with departments to solve problems, in order to make services better.</p>
                    <p>We're working in the open, using agile methods and constantly iterating, while relentlessly focusing on user needs.</p>
                    <p>CDS is not about IT. It's about service. User centric government services. It's about recognizing services need to be at the centre of our priorities as a government. Our relevance to citizens is in jeopardy if we can't deliver digital services.</p>
                    <p>We are learning from digital government movements across the globe, and working with the digital community across Canada, to shape a Canadian Digital Service.</p>
                    <p>Together, we can deliver world-class services that are simple and easy to use. It's what Canadians expect. Open. Agile. And focused on delivery. We are the Canadian Digital Service.</p>
